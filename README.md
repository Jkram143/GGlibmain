## About Module

This script is only needed to make it easier to work with Il2cpp. This script works through the program [GameGuardian](https://gameguardian.net). With the help of the module, you can get information about the method or class that interests you. This script is not positioned as a dumper, and is only needed to simplify working with Il2cpp.

The module has support for the [Lua](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yinfei.luahelper) plugin for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), that is, some functions have a description that this plugin can display.

The script is divided and available for assembly. You can also use an already built version from the [build](/build/) folder or from the [Releases](https://github.com/kruvcraft21/GGIl2cpp/releases/latest) tab. Script is built using the [luabundle](https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell/luabundle) library.

All documentation about the module is available on the [wiki](../../wiki/)
